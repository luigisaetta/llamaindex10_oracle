      "7 High Availability Data Guard Oracle Data Guard Redo Decryption for Hybrid Disaster Recovery Configurations Oracle Data Guard now provides the capability to decrypt redo operations in hybrid cloud disaster recovery configurations where the cloud database is encrypted with Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and the on-premises database is not. Hybrid disaster recovery (DR) with Data Guard is now more flexible and easy to configure. Hybrid disaster recovery for the Oracle Database allows you to expand outage and data protection to take advantage of the automation and resources of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). By enabling the ability to quickly configure disaster recovery in OCI, even in cases where on-premises databases might not already be encrypted with Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), the steps required to configure hybrid disaster recovery environments and prepare on-premises databases for a DR configuration with cloud databases in OCI have been greatly reduced. Related Resources View Documentation General Flashback Time Travel Enhancements Flashback Time Travel can automatically track and archive transactional changes to tables. Flashback Time Travel creates archives of the changes made to the rows of a table and stores the changes in history tables. It also maintains a history of the evolution of the table's schema. By maintaining the history of the transactional changes to a table and its schema, Flashback Time Travel enables you to perform operations, such as Flashback Query ( AS OF and VERSIONS ), on the table to view the history of the changes made during transaction time. Flashback Time Travel helps to meet compliance requirements based on record-stage policies and audit reports by tracking and storing transactional changes to a table, which has also been made more efficient and performant in this release.

      "Minimized Stall and More Accurate Lag Detection in Fast-Start Failover Maximum Performance Oracle Data Guard Fast-Start Failover has two additional properties for improved lag detection and status changes. FastStartFailoverLagType sets the lag type that FastStart Failover must consider when in Maximum Performance mode ( APPLY or TRANSPORT ). FastStartFailoverLagGraceTime lets the configuration transition to a preemptive LAGGING state that the observer can acknowledge before reaching the actual lag limit, so the status can transition immediately to TARGET OVER LAG LIMIT without waiting for the observer quorum. The new properties for the Maximum Performance protection mode further enhance Fast-Start Failover capabilities and reduce the impact on application transactions for status changes requiring the observer quorum. Related Resources View Documentation Transaction Guard Support during DBMS_ROLLING Transaction Guard support for DBMS_ROLLING ensures continuous application operation during the switchover issued by DBMS_ROLLING to Transient Logical Standby. The procedure uses the last commit outcome of transactions part of in-flight sessions during a switchover-related outage (or caused by an error/timeout) to protect the applications from duplicate submissions of the transactions on replay. Application Continuity supported by Transaction Guard during database upgrades using DBMS_ROLLING ensures that commit outcomes are guaranteed across the entire upgrade process.

Related Resources View Documentation ODP.NET: Centralized Config Providers Managed ODP.NET and ODP.NET Core securely retrieve application configuration data from a centralized on-premises, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, or Azure location. This store uses a JSON format and contains data, including connection descriptors and tuning parameters. Centralized application configuration makes management and cloning simpler. It suits modern architectures, such as microservices and serverless deployments. Related Resources View Documentation Optimized Performance for Parallel File System Operations This feature allows you to tune performance in environments that contain many PDBs and require multiple DBMS_FS requests to be processed in parallel. You can update the number OFS_THREADS to increase the number of DBMS_FS requests that are executed in parallel. This increases the number of worker threads executing the make, mount, unmount, and destroy operations on Oracle file systems in the Oracle database. An increase in the value of OFS_THREADS results in a significant reduction of time taken to execute parallel file system requests in environments that contain multiple PDBs. This feature significantly reduces the time required to perform parallel file system requests in consolidation environments containing multiple PDBs.

The READ_ONLY session applies to any type of user for any type of container. The READ_ONLY user only applies to local users. Providing the capability to disable and re-enable the read-write capabilities of any user or session without revoking and re-granting privileges provides you with more flexibility to temporarily control the privileges of users or sessions for testing, administration, or application development purposes.

      "Oracle Data Guard is a tool that can be used to replicate, manage and protect databases in an Oracle environment. It ensures data is continuously available and protects against data loss. With Oracle Data Guard, you can use hybrid disaster recovery to quickly configure disaster recovery in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), even if the on-premises databases are not encrypted with Transparent Data Encryption (TDE). This makes it easy to configure hybrid disaster recovery environments and prepare on-premises databases for a DR configuration with cloud databases in OCI. \n",

      "Yes, Oracle Data Guard can help achieve a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) that is close to zero. This means that in the event of a disaster, the data loss would be minimal, virtually approaching zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data Guard achieves this by continuously replicating and applying changes from the primary database to the standby databases in real-time or near-real time. The synchronous mode of Data Guard, known as Maximum Protection, ensures that the standby database remains up-to-date with the primary database. This real-time synchronization significantly reduces the time window for data loss, thereby minimizing the RPO.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Data Guard, the standby database can be configured to receive and apply changes as they occur on the primary database. This continuous replication means that when a disaster occurs, the standby database can quickly take over with nearly all transactions accounted for, resulting in an RPO that's close to zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "The actual RPO achieved depends on several factors, including the network latency between the primary and standby databases and the configuration of Data Guard. In an ideal configuration and with a robust network setup, Oracle Data Guard can help achieve an RPO that's as close to zero as technically feasible.\n",
      "\n",
      "For even stricter RPO requirements, Oracle Data Guard's Fast-Start Failover feature can further minimize the time needed to switch over to a standby database. This feature reduces the time lag between the primary and standby databases, enabling a quicker transition and an even lower RPO.\n",
